<h1>The best Movies/Shows according to Taylor</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies/Shows of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Young Royals</h3>

<p>I love how it makes me the viewer understand their emotions 
    and see all the forbidden love and drama between a prince and a townie.</p>

<h3>The Finder</h3>

<p>I like how the main character (the finder) is always able to find what he was looking for. It is quite interesting 
     how he makes specific diagrams for every lost thing allowing him to figure out where about the item could possibly be.</p>

<h3>Lost in space</h3>

<p>This show made me fall inlove with space, I love how it mades a connection
     between a robot and human and how the robot protected the person after saving it.
     I personally find that nice.</p>
