<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Taylor and I am 15, I was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand acouple months before I turned 5. I've lived in
  New Zealand since 2013 - Present. My parents menitoned coding to me when I was younger, so in year 7-8 I had my mind set on doing a job requiring coding.
  In year 9 I began learning Pyhthon, HTML along with CSS in my own time on an app called <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a>, it's quite
  similar to duolingo as you have hearts and streaks but instead of learning international languages, you learn programming languages which is pretty cool. While I was learning code on Sololearn I was also doing a digital
  technology class where we had to create our own webiste using HTML and CSS, I asked my teacher if i was able to recreate a website of my choice
  using my own knownledge of code which allowed me to take some of the information that i've learnt and try create said website. The teacher allowed to so
  I chose to recreate the starbucks website. It turned out alright but not quite like the actuall website of course.
</p>

<p>I like to challenage myself and figure things out by myself before asking others, I always get my work done on time making sure I am making improvements 
  along the way. I'm very interested in maths, and coding like HTML, CSS, and Python I'm still learning some of Javascrpit and Java, even though they can be challanging
  and confusing at times.</p>

<p>Recently I have bought some programming courses on <a href="https://udemy.com" >UDEMY</a> This portfolio is one of the activites that is part of a course I bought. 
  I like this course as it allows me to listen and watch what they are doing and then do it myself. Thus allowing me to learn more since I am a visual and doing learner.</p>
